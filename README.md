# Step-by-Step Explanation of Key Features

## Dependency Management:
The ./gradlew build and ./gradlew test commands ensure dependencies are installed and managed (using Gradle or your chosen tool).
Caching is implicitly supported by tools like Gradle to optimize dependency resolution.

## Environment Configuration:
Environment-specific credentials are securely managed using Jenkins Credentials Store (credentials() method).
Error Handling:

post { failure { ... } } blocks ensure proper notifications and logs in case of failures.
The retry(2) option retries failed stages automatically.

## Security:
Sensitive credentials (e.g., DockerHub credentials) are stored securely using Jenkins Credentials Store.
Pipeline secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords) are injected as environment variables and not hardcoded.


## Scalability:
The pipeline supports parallelism and efficient resource cleanup using Dockerâ€™s capabilities (e.g., docker system prune).


## Monitoring and Logging:
Test results are published with junit for visibility.
Stages include echo statements for clear logs.
Integration with monitoring tools like Slack or email can be added in post blocks.

## Rollback Strategy:
A rollback mechanism is implemented for production deployment failures, ensuring the pipeline reverts to a stable state.

## Approval Process:
The input step provides a manual approval checkpoint before deploying to production, ensuring stakeholder review.
